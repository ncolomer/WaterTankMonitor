This repo contains all the necessary assets to build a module monitoring and displaying the level of water in a water tank. 
The PCB layout was designed to fit in a [Legrand Mosaic obturateur](https://www.legrand.fr/pro/catalogue/obturateur-mosaic-2-modules-blanc), hence compatible with any Mosaic Support.

The project is hosted on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/199023-water-tank-monitor). See this [blogpost](https://hackaday.io/project/199023-water-tank-monitor/details) for more details about the designing and building process.

## Features
- get readings from an A02 ultrasonic sensor (UART)
- display level percentage on a 0.91" SSD1306 OLED screen (I2C)
- onboard push button to turn on display (incl. off timer)
- report readings to a Zigbee [PTVO firmware](https://ptvo.info) (UART) for integration with any home automation software

# PCB

The PCB was designed using [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/).
Project files can be found in the [`/Schematics`](https://github.com/ncolomer/WaterTankMonitor/tree/main/Schematics) directory.

It includes [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)'s [production files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncolomer/WaterTankMonitor/refs/heads/main/Schematics/jlcpcb/production_files/GERBER-Water%20Tank%20Monitor.zip) if you want to make your own.

# Firmware

The firmware was developed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
Project files can be found in [`/Firmware`](https://github.com/ncolomer/WaterTankMonitor/tree/main/Firmware) directory.

## PTVO firmware characteristics

The following infos should help you generate your own custom PTVO firmware + Zigbee2MQTT converter:
```
Board type: CC2530
Device type: Router
Model ID: water.monitor
Disable periodic On/Off reports for GPIO outputs: Yes
Status LED: P01, Sending reports
Set default reporting interval (s): 0

Output pins:
P02: Output 2, UART (UART: 115200 8N1, Packet end: 0x0D, Byte: 239)
     => UART pins are P02/RX P03/TX
P30: Output 3, UART sensor (Mode: On/Off, : Read/Write, Units: None), Remember state
     => oled display on/off state
P31: Output 4, UART sensor (Mode: Analog value, : Read, Units: None)
     => water level value in percentage
P32: Output 5, UART sensor (Mode: Analog value, : Read, Units: None)
     => measure distance to water in cm
P33: Output 6, UART sensor (Mode: Analog value, : Read/Write, Units: None), Remember state
     => configurable min measurable distance in cm
P34: Output 7, UART sensor (Mode: Analog value, : Read/Write, Units: None), Remember state
     => configurable max measurable distance in cm

Input pins:
P00: Input 1, External wake-up, Pull-up
     => onboard push button, if any
```
